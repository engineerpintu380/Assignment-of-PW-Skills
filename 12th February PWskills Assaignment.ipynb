    "An Exception in Python refers to an error that occurs during the execution of a Python program. When an error occurs, an Exception object is raised that can be caught and handled by the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of exceptions in Python, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "SyntaxError: Occurs when there is a problem with the syntax of the Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "NameError: Occurs when an object is referenced before it has been assigned a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "TypeError: Occurs when there is a problem with the type of object being used.\n",
    "\n",
    "ValueError: Occurs when a function or method receives an argument that is of the correct type but has an invalid value.\n",
    "\n",
    "IndexError: Occurs when an index is out of range.\n",
    "\n",
    "KeyError: Occurs when a dictionary key is not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between Exceptions and Syntax errors is that Syntax errors occur when there is a problem with the syntax of the code, whereas Exceptions occur during the execution of the code. Additionally, Exceptions can be caught and handled by the program, while Syntax errors cannot be caught and must be fixed in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, runtime errors or bugs are the errors that occur when a program is running. These errors can be logical or functional and can occur due to several reasons such as wrong input, improper program flow, wrong function calls, etc. Runtime errors can be caught using try-except block as exceptions, but it is not necessary that all runtime errors are exceptions. Some examples of runtime errors are DivisionByZeroError, AssertionError, AttributeError, and so on.\n"
