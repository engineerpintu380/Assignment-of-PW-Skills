The first version of Python, version 0.9.0, was released in 1991. Since then, Python has grown in popularity and has become one of the most widely used programming languages in the world."

When another object references the original object, its reference count is incremented by one. When an object is no longer needed, its reference count is decremented by one. When the reference count of an object reaches zero, it means that there are no more references to the object, and it can be safely removed from memory.\n",
